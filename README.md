Key Points:

completions: 1
* Job will run until one successful Pod completion.
* If the Pod fails, it will retry (based on backoff limits).

parallelism: 1
* Only one Pod runs at a time.
* If you set it to 3, three Pods would run simultaneously in parallel.

restartPolicy: Never
* Once the Pod completes or fails, it wonâ€™t restart.

BusyBox:

* BusyBox is a lightweight Linux utility image often called "the Swiss Army Knife of Linux".
* It provides a minimal set of Unix/Linux command-line tools (like sh, ls, echo, cat, etc.) in a single executable.
* Commonly used in testing, debugging, and simple scripting tasks in Kubernetes because it is very small (~1MB).
